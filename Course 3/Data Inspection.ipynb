Previously, you were asked to complete a project proposal by your supervisor, DeShawn Washington. You have received notice that your project proposal has been approved and that New York City TLC has given the Automatidata team access to their data. To get clear insights, New York TLC's data must be analyzed, key variables identified, and the dataset ensured it is ready for analysis.\n\nA notebook was structured and prepared to help you in this project. Please complete the questions inside and prepare a summary for the data team.",

Understand the data - Sort by variables**\n\nSort and interpret the data table for two variables of your choice.\n\n**Answer the following three questions:**\n\n**Question 1:** Sort your first variable (`trip_distance`) from maximum to minimum value, do the values seem normal?\n\n**Question 2:** Sort your by your second variable (`total_amount`), are any values unusual?\n\n**Question 3:** Are the resulting rows similar for both sorts? Why or why not?\n\n\nAnswer 1: Anomalously short trip distance of 0.00 meters and a mere 1-minute ride duration are abnormal.\n\nAnswer 2: Disparity in payment amounts between clients: the first and second clients paid $1200.29 and $450.00 respectively, notably higher than the third client who paid $258.21, attributed to their respective travel distances of 2.60 km, 0.00 km, and 33.92 km.\n\nAnswer 3: Dissimilar rows in comparison between two sorts, with significant outliers having a RatecodeID of 5 (indicating \"negotiated fare\"), complicating direct correlation.",
